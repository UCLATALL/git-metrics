## What is it?

This package provides methods for compiling git activity over arbitrary time-periods (optionally outputting to CSV) and comparing the state of a repository to a previous state using git to produce a similarity metric. As time and interest permit, these metrics and methods will be expanded.

## Installing

This package is only available through its GitHub repo. We will attempt to always keep the `main` branch stable, with upcoming improvements on the `develop` branch.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/UCLATALL/git-metrics.git@main
```
